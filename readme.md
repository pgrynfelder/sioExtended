# sioExtended

## Installation guide
### Firefox:
1. Download the [XPI package](../../raw/master/sioextended.xpi).

### Chrome:
Sadly, Chrome by default allows to install extensions only from the official store, which costs a developer license.
If you are an advanced user, go on and install the [CRX package](../../raw/master/sioextended.crx) through the developer settings.
1. Go to *Extensions* menu (<chrome://extensions/>).
2. Turn on developer mode.
3. Unpack the CRX package as .zip to a folder or just download the source.
4. Click *load unpacked* and select the folder from step 3.
